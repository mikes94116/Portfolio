# Portfolio

Centralized presentation of coding projects, and expanded personal and professional information as created by and about Michael Sevik (Mike)... 

Here, easily navigate your way around coding projects Mike has created by way of this aesthetically intuitive and hopefully appealing layout, which includes examples of JavaScript front-end, and through to the back-end. 

But don't stop there... go further!... find out more about Mike by reading the 'about me' section... accessing Mike's LinkedIn profile, or even his Instagram feed.
